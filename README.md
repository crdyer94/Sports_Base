# Sports Base

Sports Base is an app that lets users search and favorite athletes in the National Football league. Each player has his own profile that shows his general bio information, recent career stats, recent tweets, and his arrest records. The data displayed on the athlete's profile is pulled from the mysportsfeed API, NFL Arrests API and the Twitter API. When an athlete is favorited, a shortcut to that athlete's profile is displayed on the user's homepage.
